      <h1>TO OUR CUSTOMERS</h1>
        <div className="thirdContentTextColumn">
      
        <p>From the beginning, our passion for bowhunting & innovation has fueled us in looking to the future, always asking “what-if” & searching for ways to help our customers be more successful in the field.
        </p>

        <p>Even now, having shipped over 1 million crossbows since 1994, the same guiding principles that drove our company then, continue to drive us today – Family Owned & Built in America.</p>
        
        <p>Our commitment to these principles allows us to design, engineer, & build better crossbows than large multi-brand corporations who don’t truly know & love the sport. From ownership & management to our skilled team of employees, we are passionate bowhunters who understand the hunt boils down to a game of inches, & we take great pride in being part of your success.
        </p>

        <p>From top-to-bottom, our 2024 lineup breaks boundaries & sets new standards in crossbow speed, accuracy, durability, & performance. As we usher in A New Era, you will find that our lineup not only includes the fastest crossbows in the world & the most compact hunting systems on the market, but also budget-friendly, performance-driven crossbows. Simply put, our 2024 lineup has a crossbow for everyone at every budget, & we look forward to sharing in your success this year!
